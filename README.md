# Environment for running tidyverse + ggplot2 tutorials

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mrajeev08/ggplot-demo/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio) 

Based on the [rocker/geospatial](https://hub.docker.com/r/rocker/geospatial)
image so should have all tidyverse and spatial dependencies, as well as RStudio
instance.

Built using the [rocker-org/binder](https://github.com/rocker-org/binder) template, 
see that repo for full set-up instructions.
